# Vuoro project scope

This repository participates in the `vuoro` multi-repository project. The
project is a read and instruction projection; each member repository remains
the authority for its own runtime behavior and Git history.

- Canonical binding and shared sources live in the `agentops` home repository.
- Cross-cutting project work is tracked in the agentops sprintctl backlog.
- Use `sprintctl usage --context --project --json` and
  `sprintctl next-work --project --json --explain` from a materialized project
  folder. Every union row must retain its `origin_repo`.
- Direct repository sessions remain supported. Omitting `--project` must keep
  the repository-local sprintctl behavior unchanged.
- Project instructions are baseline guidance followed by member-owned
  overrides. The member's authored `AGENTS.md` remains authoritative for local
  workflow and safety constraints.

Before a cross-repository work window, synchronize the derived project folder.
Treat dirty, divergent, or unexpectedly branched member worktrees as a stop
condition; resolve them through the owning repository rather than resetting
them from project tooling.

## Ecosystem ownership and safety boundaries

- `agentops` owns reusable dispatch templates, project bindings and render
  tooling, cross-repository guidance, and the cockpit application source.
- `sprintctl`, `kctl`, and `actionq` own their respective runtime semantics and
  state. Do not add raw cross-tool database writes or cross-tool transactions.
- The former `outctl` member is retired from active Vuoro scope. Its repository
  remains a frozen discovery artifact; new harness-evidence work belongs at the
  native runtime boundary and targets standard OpenTelemetry plus Langfuse
  (selected 2026-09-14) with object storage rather than a new evidence product.
- Inspect declared `risk_surfaces` before changing queue, claim, lease, retry,
  recovery, projection, publication, reconciliation, or backend-parity paths.
  `full` is a sequence of scoped actions, not blanket mutation authority.
- Keep browser-facing cockpit writes behind documented owning APIs. Project
  scope does not authorize cluster reconciliation, image publication, or
  deployment changes.
- Reusable dispatch behavior stays canonical in agentops. Express a member's
  true difference in its own `.agents/overlays/` fragment instead of copying a
  shared skill body.

Check generated guidance with the deterministic renderer in agentops. Missing,
stale, or hand-edited output is regenerated from canonical sources; it is never
merged manually.

## Portfolio disposition

Generated from `vuoro:docs/direction/disposition-register.yaml` by
`agentops:scripts/render_disposition_fragment.py`. Do not edit
here; change the register and re-render.

The register records status separately from intention: intention is what a plan
wants, status is what the artifact supports. Where a document and the register
disagree about whether something exists, the register was checked at the artifact.
Each entry's waking condition, evidence and supersession live in the register.

### retiring

- `actionq` — PostgreSQL-backed action queue and authority plane - mints actions, hands out fenced claims… Retires: actionq-db and actionq-db-proxy drop in S2 item 7 once the dump, test restore and scale-to-zero evidence holds.

### Open claims

Each was re-derived from the artifact and did not reproduce as stated. Do not cite the original figure or sequence work against it.

- **Served next-work works, but the product's first promised capability - session resume -…** True only in its weakest reading (no served operation spelled 'session resume' exists) and false under the decision record's own test, the…
- **Cost telemetry is overstated by 5.4-5.9x.** Overstatement is real; the figure is not.
- **69% of recorded session events are fixtures, and agentops consumed 31% of measured effort.** The contamination is real and far worse than 69%; the 31% is unsupported and contradicted by every recomputation.
- **Native runtimes increasingly own session resume, subagents, hooks, skills and…** Two-thirds evidenced, one-third assumed.
- **The multi-agent coordination layer should be frozen (stop developing it).** The conclusion is right and v1's reasoning was wrong twice.
