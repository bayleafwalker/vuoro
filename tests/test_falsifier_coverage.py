"""Every normative claim in an opted-in plan document names a falsifying test.

Measurement track item 2.  The four W3 review rounds produced two defects that
no amount of test-writing would have caught, because the tests encoded the
belief being tested:

* "mutable facts last" was documented as load-bearing and was not -- a reviewer
  disproved it by inverting the order and observing identical writes;
* "putting expected_revision in the idempotency key makes a rejected fact
  recoverable" was claimed in a commit message and a PR comment. The test for it
  passed, and passed *for the right reason* -- but it exercised the case where
  the live revision had moved, which is narrower than the claim the prose made.

So presence of a matching test is necessary and not sufficient, and this module
checks both dimensions:

1. **Coverage** -- every inline ``<!-- claim: id -->`` marker is accounted for
   in the document's ``falsifiers`` block, and vice versa.  A claim may be
   declared an explicit gap, but only with a reason, and the coverage ratio is
   pinned below so that lowering it is a visible edit rather than a silent
   drift.
2. **Scope** -- the falsifier records the scope the claim is limited to, and
   that text must appear in the named test's own docstring.  Widening a claim
   therefore fails here until someone edits the test's docstring, which is the
   moment to ask whether the test still proves what the claim now says.

Neither check can make a claim true.  What they do is stop a claim from being
broadened silently, which is exactly how both W3 defects reached a PR comment.

Ported from actionq (``tests/test_falsifier_coverage.py``) unchanged except
``DOC_ROOTS``, which is the whole ``docs/`` tree here rather than two named
directories: Vuoro's claim-bearing documents are not confined to
``docs/plans/``, and a document that opts in from ``docs/architecture/`` should
be gated, not invisible. The W3 defects cited above are ActionQ's; they are kept
because they are what the two checks below were built from, and the second one
-- a claim broadened past the test that was supposed to falsify it -- is not a
defect class this repository is any less exposed to.
