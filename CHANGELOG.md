# Changelog

All notable changes to the separately versioned Vuoro distributions will be
recorded here.

## Unreleased

- vuoro-client 0.1.1: authenticate `GET /api/meta/v1/handshake` and
  `GET /api/catalog/v1` whenever the profile has a credential (hosted
  vuoro.cloud answered 401 to served sprintctl), and send a named
  `User-Agent: vuoro-client/<version>` on every request (Cloudflare refuses
  generic ones). (#125)
- vuoro-service 0.1.75 / vuoro-mcp-edge 0.1.2: `describe_work` for a missing
  item is an ordinary `item-not-found` tool error logged at INFO, no longer a
  "work source failed" warning; real unavailability is unchanged. (#126)
- vuoro-worker: the internal MCP server answers with 2026-07-28
  `resultType: "complete"` (the domain kind moves to `kind`) and
  `cacheScope` public/private. (#127)

- vuoro-service 0.1.74 / vuoro-mcp-edge 0.1.1: MCP results carry
  `resultType: "complete"` and list results `cacheScope: "private"`, as
  revision 2026-07-28 requires. The per-method names before this made Claude
  Code and hosted Routines drop every Vuoro tool.

- Add `vuoro-service mcp-serve` and restore `packages/vuoro-mcp-edge`: the MCP
  protocol server (`list_ready_work`, `describe_work`) over gateway identity
  assertions, reading sprintctl's `work.public.*-v1` contract through the
  runtime shell. Remove the static-bearer `vuoro_service.mcp_surface` module.

- Bootstrap the public repository and independent `vuoro-client` and
  `vuoro-service` package boundaries.
- Add protocol-v1 handshake, ETag catalog, safe JSON Schema registration,
  identity-derived generic invocation, and dynamic operation discovery.
