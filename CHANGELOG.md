# Changelog

All notable changes to the separately versioned Vuoro distributions will be
recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Add `vuoro-service mcp-serve` and restore `packages/vuoro-mcp-edge`: the MCP
  protocol server (`list_ready_work`, `describe_work`) over gateway identity
  assertions, reading sprintctl's `work.public.*-v1` contract through the
  runtime shell. Remove the static-bearer `vuoro_service.mcp_surface` module.

- Bootstrap the public repository and independent `vuoro-client` and
  `vuoro-service` package boundaries.
- Add protocol-v1 handshake, ETag catalog, safe JSON Schema registration,
  identity-derived generic invocation, and dynamic operation discovery.
